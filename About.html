            <p>We're known more by the impact we create than the titles we hold. Impact that is brought by working together on audacious challenges at scale with an aim to revolutionize for the Indian customer. We believe great ideas can emerge from anywhere and must be backed. Our people - backed by our culture of end-to-end ownership - have revolutionised India's e-commerce sector - several times over!</p>

            <p>Our journey of building India's biggest unicorn start-up has been full of successes, but also failures and learning from them. That's why there's calculated risk-taking, a high willingness to learn and improvise, and a growth orientation built into everything we do. Whether it be opening a new warehouse, or making our mobile app a bit more consumer friendly, we're always experimenting, learning and growing!</p>
